 I got a dataset on Kaggle, : archive.zip
    Downloaded and unzipped the file
    It includes:
    2 folders (train(image,label), val(image,label))
    And 2 files: classess, coco128.yaml
(I renamed coco128.yaml to data.yaml (not mandetory))
First:
    Create and run the yolo model (ONCE) : python train_model.py
    (Automatically create the runs folder (+ subfolders and file))

Then I wrote the code in detect.py
For deployment: app.py, static, templates

Unfortunately, the dataset is very small, so the accuracy is very low.

So I decided to create a new dataset using python toools,

    I chose Roboflow, an online tool to easily create this type of dataset

    I took the images for it (from train, tail image) +
                                    I downloaded many other images from Google

    I created a new dataset, downloaded that dataset,

I tried using the new dataset here and got better results.


at last , run python app.py
browse : 127.0.0.5050
